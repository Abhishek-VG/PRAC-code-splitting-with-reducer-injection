## This project contains 3 branches
## Master
Neither code splitted nor reducer injected dynamically, regular flow without any performance improvement(It is Bad practise to follow this method)

## Code-split
Code splitting is done using react loadable

## reducer-injection
Reducers are injected dynamically, with code splitted (Best way to code)

Compare all three projects and understand the importance of code splitting and reducer-injection
